## My Japanese Literature Exploration

Japanese literature has captivated me with its unique aesthetics, philosophical depth, and cultural insights. I've been diving into both classical and contemporary works to better understand Japanese storytelling traditions.

## Authors I'm Exploring

### Classical
- **Murasaki Shikibu** - *The Tale of Genji*
- **Matsuo Bash≈ç** - Haiku poetry
- **Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki** - *In Praise of Shadows*

### Contemporary
- **Haruki Murakami** - *Kafka on the Shore*, *The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle*
- **Y≈çko Ogawa** - *The Memory Police*
- **Sayaka Murata** - *Convenience Store Woman*

## Themes I'm Interested In

- **Mono no aware** - The pathos of things; awareness of impermanence
- **Ma** - Negative space concept in Japanese aesthetics
- **Wabi-sabi** - Beauty in imperfection
- **Iki** - Simplicity, sophistication, spontaneity

## Reading Notes

### On Murakami's Surrealism
Murakami's blend of the mundane and the surreal creates a dreamlike quality that somehow feels more real than reality. His characters often drift between worlds, mirroring the way our minds move between concrete reality and intangible emotions.

### The Significance of Seasons
Japanese literature pays close attention to seasonal references, with many works explicitly noting seasonal changes. This connects to the Buddhist concept of impermanence and the circular nature of existence.

## Reading List

- *Snow Country* by Yasunari Kawabata
- *A Personal Matter* by Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe
- *Strange Weather in Tokyo* by Hiromi Kawakami
- *The Makioka Sisters* by Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki
