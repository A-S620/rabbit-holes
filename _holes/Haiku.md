Haiku is a form of Japanese poetry made up of 3 verses with a 5-7-5 syllable pattern (17 in total).

Here are some of my Haikus:
> Jade stands on the ledge,
> The sun is shyly hiding,
> Tomorrow shall come.

> Sun is out to play,
> Sweetness spreads through my body,
> light is everywhere

> Birds sing together,
> The distant roar of machines,
> Music surrounds us.

> Rain sits on window,
> Music flowing through my ears,
> I notice this life.
