Rabbit Holes is a custom web app I built inspired by the concept of digital gardens, I first came in this [video by Anna Howard](https://youtu.be/0tY7Z53QJo8?si=3EhIRarRR4dMl8ZJ) 
I was inspired to do my own version of this, which was how Rabbit Holes was born. Each `hole` is a topic or area that interests me. The goal is to simply allow myself to follow my curiosity organically, document my thoughts and eventually build a graph of 'connections'. I wanted it to be fun and cute (which I think it is!).

Its super simple, its built using HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby and Jekyll. The notes are md files, which makes them portable and reusable.

One extremely cool thing about how this whole system works, is that Ive connected the [rabbit holes](https://github.com/A-S620/rabbit-holes) repository to an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault on my phone. So, I can edit and update my .md files locally. Then the Github Gitless Sync community plugin syncs my local changes to the GitHub repository. And every time there are new changes pushed to master, Github will run a pages build and deployment action that builds the entire Jekyll Web app! So I can pretty much type on my phone, sync everything and have an updated web app in about 5 minutes. It's one of the coolest techy things I've done recently. 

# The anatomy of a hole
Every hole file starts with:

Which is the basic information that organises all the holes. Pretty self explanatory. The only key thing here is to create a connection, you need to put the slug of the connected hole and also update that hole with the slug of your new hole, if you dont do this it breaks the D3.js graph.

After this, you have free reign to write any markdown you want.

In some places you may notice`[[ ... ]]` syntax, which is the syntax Obsidian uses to create connections between pages. Ive left this in because it doesnt really impact the UX of the web app and makes the local notes more useful to me.  I get a handy graph locally, which shows the connections between the pages:
