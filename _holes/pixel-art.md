## My Pixel Art Journey

I've always been fascinated by the charming aesthetics of pixel art. There's something magical about creating detailed worlds and characters with limited pixels that captures my imagination!

## What I've Learned

- Basic pixel art fundamentals (lines, curves, shapes)
- Color theory specific to pixel art (limited palettes)
- Animation principles for pixel sprites
- Different pixel art styles (from 8-bit to 32-bit)

## Tools I Use

- **Aseprite** - My main pixel art software
- **Pixaki** - For iPad pixel art creation
- **Pyxel Edit** - Great for tileset creation

## Favorite Pixel Artists

1. **Waneella** - Amazing pixel art scenes with beautiful lighting
2. **Paul Robertson** - Incredibly detailed and dynamic pixel animations
3. **eBoy** - Complex isometric pixel art cityscapes

## Current Projects

I'm working on a small collection of pixel art environments inspired by my favorite places. So far I've completed:

- Cozy bedroom scene
- Rainy coffee shop
- Sunset beach

## Resources I Love

- [Pixel Art Academy](https://pixelart.academy/)
- [Lospec](https://lospec.com/) for color palettes and tutorials
- r/PixelArt subreddit

## Future Pixel Art Explorations

I want to try creating:
- An animated character sprite sheet
- Isometric pixel art environments
- Pixel art UI elements for a game
