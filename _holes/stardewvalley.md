Stardew Valley is a farming RPG created by Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) and first released in 2016. I bought this game back in October 2021 and have since spent over 150 hours on it in the past few years.


My favourite song from Stardew Valley is [Spring (It's a Big World Outside)](https://spotify.link/0ibpqiyXSXb).

It is amazing to me that ConcernedApe built the entirety of Stardew Valley all by himself. Along with that in itself being amazing, Stardew Valley is genuinely one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life. I think Im done with the game then constantly find myself returning to it.

When I first started playing the game I did not understand the fishing mechanic at all, it took me way longer than I'd like to admit to learn how to fish.

The thing that really drew me to this game was how cozy and relaxing it was, the story elements were incredibly well made and the characters were beautiful. I'm pretty sure I made it my goal to woo Abigail, but ended up picking Elliot in the end.
