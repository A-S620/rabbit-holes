This is to keep track of all the games I've played on the R36HD Retro Handheld Video Game Console. I bought this console because I was craving the nostalgia of being drawn into a game for hours. 

For the first time in my life, I have alot of space. Physical space and space in time and energy. I found myself endlessly doomscrolling, trying to fill this new found space with anything. But of course, social media has a steep downward slope of diminishing returns. And whilst it does the trick its extremely unsatisfying.

So when my friend mentioned this magical Console with supposedly 20,000 games, I didnt think twice and ordered it off Ebay immediately.

This hole is an attempt to mindfully indulge in the games. The thing I'm most excited to do is replay all the games that I remember loving so much. The only proof that I ever played those games is in my memory, so I suppose that by documenting it here Im creating proof that these things are part of my identity.

The first game I wanted to start off with is Barbie. The console has Tekken too,  but Im drawn to Barbie more. I distinctly remember playing it. So maybe this is adulthood, sitting on my couch, in my pyjamas, skincare done and playing Barbie on a retro console.
## Barbie
The game I remember playing is called Barbie: Princess and the Pauper. It's still pretty engaging though I'm not sure about the retro music soundtrack. For all the games really, Im still getting used to the sound again. Ive also seen that this has Barbie and the 12 dancing princesses, the movie had an incredible soundtrack so maybe the game will too.

## Harvest Moon
Im trying Harvest moon for the first time ever and its really reminding me of Stardew Valley! I wonder if Concerned Ape was inspired by it?

I think I'd like to try more RPG games specifically, since I do enjoy storytelling elements in my games. There seems to be a fair few of them on this console! So many to get through.
