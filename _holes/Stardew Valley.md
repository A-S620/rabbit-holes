Stardew Valley is a farming RPG created by Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) and first released in 2016. I bought this game back in October 2021 and have since spent over 150 hours on it in the past few years.

My favourite song from the Stardew Valley soundtrack is [Spring (It's a Big World Outside)](https://spotify.link/0ibpqiyXSXb).

It is amazing to me that ConcernedApe built the entirety of Stardew Valley all by himself. It is genuinely one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life. I always think Im done with the game then find myself returning to it.

When I first started playing I didn't understand the fishing mechanic at all, it took me way longer than I'd like to admit to learn how to fish. It was so bad that I had to wait to buy most of the fish I needed for the community centre from the travelling cart.

The thing that really drew me to this game was how cozy and relaxing it was, the story elements are incredibly well made and the characters are beautiful. I'm pretty sure I made it my goal to woo Abigail, but ended up picking Elliot in the end.

Elliot was always kind to the farmer even when he didnt know them. Plus, hes a gentle writer type, with lucious locks and small crabs in his pockets. It was inevitable that I picked him in the end. And he actually makes a great partner after you marry him, he makes you coffee and is so supportive! Not that I know what having any other of the characters as a partner is like. I simply cannot bring myself to divorce him on my copy. Maybe one day I'll start a new copy and try to follow the story with another character, but for now its only Elliot.
