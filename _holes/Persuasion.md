> Persuasion is a book written by Jane Austen, originally published 20 December 1817

I first read Persuasion at a turning point in my life. After spending 20 and most of 21 completely indoors during Covid 19, I had decided to treat myself to my first solo vacation in Bath. Why Bath? Because I've been obsessed with Jane Austen since the age of thirteen. And I don't think I can ever adequetly describle the elation I felt when I walked along Gravel Walk and realised that was exactly where Captian Wentworth and Anne reconciled in the book! 

I sat on the banks of the River Avon, in the Bath City Parade Gardens and read. The sun was shinning brightly in the middle of July, flowers bloomed all around me, it was warm and I was reading Austen's most sombre book. It felt right somehow, the pandemic had suspended time for me and I felt much older than I was; Anne's gentle melancholy was reassuring.

Ironically enough when I first read it, I hadn't really experienced the level of heartbreak that Anne went through. It would only be years later, when I experineced a similar sitaution, that I would truly appreciate the book. Whilst the book ends happily, it is mostly a sad book. The way in which Austen extensively describes the resigned pain that Anne feels is refreshing, especially in the world we live in now, where pinning and yearning isn't cool anymore. Anne accepts her pain and sadness gently, and she accepts that her life may never actually be the same, that she may not recover. In contrast, today, we have a culture that pushes "get over it" and heartbreak almost becomes an egotisical thing where we need to show that we've glowed up after, that we are so much better without whoever we left behind.

But we, the lover girls of today, can take some comfort from this book. We can learn to recognise the beauty of heartbrake and accept that there are certain people who we will always love, even if they are not in our life right now, and there is quiet strength in that. There is strength in knowing that you loved someone with all that you were and so fiercly that it is impossible to erase them from your essance. There is a beauty in accepting that everyone that we've ever loved will somehow still be a part of us. We don't have to get over it, we can choose to gently sit with those feelings as Anne does.

This story is also about hope. The idea that if two people are really meant for each other, they will find their way back to each other. The book doesn't choose the easy type of hope where Anne and Captian Wentworth easily get back to each other. The hope is more active than that, it requires work. It required Captain Wentworth to evaluate his anger, resentment and ego so that he was able to recognise in time that he still loved Anne. And alternatively, I also think that it required Anne to be more confident within herself and learn to appreciate herself. It didn't magically happen, for the present version of Anne and Wentworth to be together, they both had to grow individually, even though that growth was painful at times.

I've reread the book multiple times over since that time in July back in 2022, its accompanied me on many journeys because I bought a small, collectors addition thats easy to carry around. Every time I do read it, I find different perspectives I hadn't thought of before and by the time I finish I always feel lighter than when I started. It makes me feel gently hopeful, which is why I return to it so often. 

I imagine that the thoughts I've documented here will evolve, but for now I want to reference some of my favourite quotes from the book:

The most iconic letter in the entire history of human kind, I get chills every time I re-read this part of the book:
>"I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago."

Bittersweet as sentances:
>"There could have never been two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved. Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted. It was a perpetual estrangement."

Jane Austen invented the concept of confirmation bias:
>"How quick come the reasons for approving what we like."

Me after reading Wentworths letter about 500 times:
>"Let us never underestimate the power of a well-written letter."

What a gentle way of laughing at yourself:
>"She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! Alas! She must confess to herself that she was not wise yet."

Relatable on so many levels, I should probably speak to a therapist about this:
>"She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning."

To love is to know and be known:
>"There they returned again into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their reunion than when it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other’s character, truth, and attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting"
