## How I found this

Whilst looking for a video to put in the background, I stumbled across this set by [sojuyakultplaka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkZNr40tuKU).

A genre of music created in Japaneses cities. it emerged in the late 1970s and gained popularity in the 1980s.

It combines a bunch of genres like funk, disco, R&B, AOR, soft rock and boogie.

At the time artists used unique musical vocabulary and new Japanese music technology to create a distinct style.

## What makes a citypop tune?
- Smoothness - the songs' gotta wash over you like a ray of sunshine on a breezy day. This is done by adding in Jazz chords and melodies.
- Depth - Artists used innovative synthesisers to create unique sounds.
- Beat - They used drums to add a beat to the music. Instead of making the drums seem like a machine, they added a human touch to them.
- Spice - Artists used extra magic like horns, backing vocals, and percussion to add a little extra something to the music.

## Why I enjoy it
It makes me feel like I want to just sway to the beat, be present and dance.
