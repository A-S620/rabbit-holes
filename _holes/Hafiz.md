> Hafiz (Shams-ud-din Muhammad) is one of the greatest Persian poets from the 13th Century. 

# First Impressions

I first came across Hafiz at the start of 2022. The instructor at a workshop I was attending recommended I Heard God Laughing By Daniel Ladinsky. I devoured all of the poems in a single day, and just as Hafiz had intended, felt as though with each word light was being poured into me.

2022 was a weird year, the pandemic wasnt fully over yet but the world was starting to open up.  Within myself, I felt the same too.  I had just come out of some really dark times, my mental health in the gutter and was just about beginning to feel somewhat normal again.  So when I read poems by Hafiz, I really felt as though this book had found me at the perfect time.

As I read the poems, I felt held. Like I could truly lay my head down and rest for once. As though all my problems had suddenly been taken care of and the only thing I had left to do was simply be. 

This book singlehandedly shifted my entire perspective on God, from an authoritative judge to an all loving, joyful friend. And as someone who doesnt necessarily believe they have a grand purpose to fulfill, I found that "to love" is what it really is all about. I often find myself going back to Hafiz when life feels heavier than I can bare.

# Parts of the whole
So on this page I want to record my reflections on his poetry as I continue to reread them. The order of peoms follows the order in the book I heard God Laughing By Daniel Ladinsky, with each heading being the corresponding title in the book. This is my analysis of what I think each poem means.

# You Are With The Friend Now
Hafiz prepares us for the journey of love.

## A Divine Invitation
"We can come to God
Dressed for Dancing,
Or
Be Carried on a stretcher
To God's Ward"

This poem tells me that Hafiz believes there are only 2 paths a life can take, whilst both lead to the same destination, one journey is joyous and easy whilst the other is difficult and painful.

## You Don't Have to act Crazy Anymore
"Look in a clear mountain mirror
See the beautiful ancient warrior
And the divine elements 
You always carry inside

That infused this universe with sacred life
So long ago"

There is a part of us which is as old as the universe itself, the journey of life is reconnecting with this part of ourselves.

## We Should Talk About This Problem
"There is a Beautiful Creature
Living in a hole you have dug."

We have put ourselves in the places that we feel safe.

"So at night
I set fruit and grains
And little pots of wine and milk
Beside your soft earthen mounds,

And I often sing."

And there is so much delight to be gained from releasing what we know (and feel comfortable with), and stepping into the fresh air. Because whilst we might feel safe, we can't enjoy the delights life has to offer (wine and milk I'm taking as the good in life)

"But still, my dear,
You do not come out.

I have fallen in love with Someone
Who hides inside you.

We should talk about this problem—

Otherwise,
I will never leave you alone."

To me this comes across as a mixture of amazement and acceptance of the reader being a flawed individual, regardless Hafiz is still hopeful that (through his poems), he will draw us out from our hiding places.

## And Applaud 
"Sweet Heart,
Do you really want me to speak to you
About all your attachments,

When I can see so clearly
You have built, with so much care,
Such a great brothel
To house all of your pleasures."

I see this as we are holding on to the parts of ourselves we need to let go, yet can't bring ourselves to. So we keep these things in the dark and "bad" place in ourselves so that we can revisit them when no one is watching us. Because perhaps we feel we can only be more of ourselves there.

I also see attachments as a synonym for addictions/ desires.

"So that you can sneak away
From time to time
And try to squeeze light
Into your parched being
From a source as fruitful
As a dried pit
That even a bird
Is wise enough to spit out."

We can visit those dark things about ourselves whenever we want, but they will never truly fulfill us. Yes, it'll do the trick in the moment but we will feel more parched than before.

"Hafiz knows
The torments and the agonies
every mind on the way to Annihilation in the Sun
Must endure."

Hafiz sees this as an essential step towards becoming who you truly are. To truly get to the place of loving God, perhaps one must realise that desires (just like courtesans) are simply distractions from being truly fulfilled in life.

"So at night in my prayers I often stop
And ask a thousand angels to join in
And Applaud,

And Applaud
Anything,
Anything in this world
That can bring your heart comfort!”

Hafiz recognises that we are always searching for comfort, and here he hopes that we will find it through sources that give us abundant light rather than us having to "squeeze light".

## Manic Screaming
"We should make all spiritual talk
simple today:
God is trying to sell you something,
But you don’t want to buy .
That is what your suffering is:
Your fantastic haggling,
Your manic screaming over the price!"

This is laughter over the human condition and how simple everything is. What we need is being given to us and maybe we know exactly what it takes to get it, but are in denial. We continue to haggle, when we could simply accept the price and enjoy what "God" is selling to us.

## My Brilliant Image
"One day the sun admitted
I am just a shadow.
I wish I could show you
The infinite incandescence
That has cast my brilliant image!
I wish I could show you,
When you are lonely or in darkness,
The Astonishing Light
Of your own Being!"

Just because we cannot see our own light, or how 'brilliant' we are, doesn't mean it doesnt exist. I think Hafiz is reassuring us that even in our worst moments we are still creatures of the light.

## Cast All Your Votes For Dancing
 "I know the voice of depression
Still calls to you.

I know those habits that can ruin your life
Still send their invitations."

Its almost as if Hafiz is saying that its easy to fall in despair, its easy to be miserable. But even though it's easy, it never fills us.

"But you are with the Friend now
And look so much stronger.

You can stay that way
And even bloom!"

When we let go of what we know (the voice of depression), we have to trust the Friend (God - Hafiz uses the term 'Friend' to describe God often)

"Keep squeezing drops of the Sun
From your prayers and work and music
And from your companions’ beautiful laughter."

Despite the despair, there are ways for us to quench our parched souls. Our souls will always crave light and luckily we can get light.

"Keep squeezing drops of the Sun
From the sacred hands and glance of your Beloved
And, my dear,
From the most insignificant movements
Of your own holy body."


I think this means that God (our Beloved) sends signs of his love which are often subtle. 

Perhaps the second part of this stanza is talking about how our body already knows where to find this light, but our mind doesn't.

"Learn to recognize the counterfeit coins
That may buy you just a moment of pleasure,
But then drag you for days
Like a broken man
Behind a farting camel."

The temporary things that bring us pleasure are cheap but hurt us. Also Hafiz is ridiculously comedic at times.

"You are with the Friend now.
Learn what actions of yours delight Him,
What actions of yours bring freedom
And Love."

To me, this is about letting go of what we think we should be doing and surrendering (and trusting) the Friend to lead us.

"Whenever you say God’s name, dear pilgrim,
My ears wish my head was missing
So they could finally kiss each other
And applaud all your nourishing wisdom!"

Remembering God (or rather that there is more to life than whats immediately in front of us) is nourishing for our soul.

"Now, sweet one,
Be wise.
Cast all your votes for Dancing!"

Let go and simply trust in the rythm of life. Like a dance, where singular movements don't always make sense, added together it creates a beautiful performance. So I think Hafiz is priming us to lighten up because to be with the Friend we must be light.

Like dancing, what we are meant to be doing is already innate to us. Dancing transcends languages and is intuitive. All we have to do is follow the rhythm, our body and soul already knows what its doing.

# Come To My House
## What Happens
"What happens when your soul
Begins to awaken
Your eyes
And your heart
And the cells of your body
To the great Journey of Love?"

The journey of love starts from the soul, the rest of the body follows automatically when the first step is taken.

"First there is wonderful laughter
And probably precious tears

And a hundred sweet promises
And those heroic vows
No one can ever keep."

When our soul awakens, do we feel this urge to makeup for lost time with our new discoveries. Its aslmost as though we go through the stages of grief as part of the journey.

"But still God is delighted and amused
You once tried to be a saint."

Do we try and apporach this new relationship to God the same that we do our attachments? And it doesn't work beacuse this is different. Whats required is different and so much lighter.

"What happens when your soul
Begins to awake in this world

To our deep need to love
And serve the Friend?

O the Beloved
Will send you
One of His wonderful, wild companions—

Like Hafiz."

We find Hafiz at the exact right time we were supposed to, no sooner or later. And its almost as if Hafiz is saying he and his poetry are gifts from God to us to help us on this journey.
