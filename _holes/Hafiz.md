I first came across Hafiz at the start of 2022. The instructor at a workshop I was attending recommend I Heard God Laughing By Daniel Ladinsky. I devoured all of the poems in a single day, and just as Hafiz had intended, felt as though with each word light was being poured into me.

2022 was a weird year, the pandemic wasnt fully over yet but the world was starting to open up.  Within myself, I felt the same too.  I had just come out of some really dark times, my mental health in the gutter and was just about beginning to feel somewhat normal again.  So when I read poems by Hafiz, I really felt as though this book had found me at the perfect time.

As I read the poems, I felt held. Like I could truly lay my head down and rest for once. As though all my problems had suddenly been taken care of and the only thing I had left to do was simply be. 

This book singlehandedly shifted my entire perspective on God, from an authoritative judge to an all loving, joyful friend. And as someone who doesnt necessarily believe they have a grand purpose to fulfill, I found that "to love" is what it really is all about. I often find myself going back to Hafiz when life feels heavier than I can bare.
