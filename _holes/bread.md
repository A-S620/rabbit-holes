## Why I love baking bread

Bread baking has become one of my favorite activities! There's something magical about the transformation of simple ingredients—flour, water, salt, and yeast—into a beautiful, crusty loaf of bread.

## What I've learned so far

- The importance of proper fermentation
- How to create and maintain a sourdough starter
- Different kneading techniques
- How to shape various bread styles

## My favorite recipes

### Basic Sourdough Loaf

1. 450g bread flour
2. 325g water
3. 100g active sourdough starter
4. 10g salt

Mix, ferment for 4-6 hours, shape, proof overnight in the refrigerator, and bake at 450°F in a Dutch oven.

### Focaccia

This oil-enriched Italian bread is amazing with rosemary and sea salt on top!
